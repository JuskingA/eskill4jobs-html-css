# ACTIVITY 2: ADDING HEADINGS
AND PARAGRAPHS
Open your index.html file in your text editor.
• Locate the <body> tag: This is where you'll add your content.
• Create a heading: Use <h1> for the main heading, <h2> for subheadings, and
so on.
Example:
<h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
• Create paragraphs: Use <p> tags to create paragraphs of text.
Example:
<p>This is a paragraph.</p>
• Structure your content: Use multiple headings and paragraphs to organize your
page.


To complete 

**Activity 2: Adding Headings and Paragraphs** in your `index.html` file, follow these steps:

### 1. **Open `index.html` File**
   - Open the `index.html` file located in your **"html"** folder using any text editor (e.g., VS Code, Sublime Text, or Notepad++).

### 2. **Locate the `<body>` Tag**
   - In the `index.html` file, find or add the `<body>` tag, as this is where the visible content of your webpage will be placed.

### 3. **Add Headings**
   - Use different heading tags to create a structured layout for your page. For example, `<h1>` is used for the main heading, while `<h2>` and other heading tags (like `<h3>`, `<h4>`) are for subheadings.

```html
<h1>Welcome to My Website</h1>
<h2>About Us</h2>
<h3>Our Mission</h3>
```

### 4. **Add Paragraphs**
   - Use the `<p>` tag to create paragraphs of text that go under each heading.

```html
<p>This is a paragraph providing an introduction to the website.</p>
<p>We are dedicated to providing excellent services to our users.</p>
```

### 5. **Structure the Content**
   - Combine headings and paragraphs to organize the content of your webpage. Below is an example of how the full structure might look:

```html
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
