| `git remote -v` | Lists remote repositories connected to your local repo. | `git remote -v` |
| `git remote add <name> <url>` | Adds a new remote repository. | `git remote add origin https://github.com/user/repo.git` |
| `git fetch <remote-name>` | Fetches changes from a remote repository without merging. | `git fetch origin` |
| `git pull <remote-name> <branch-name>` | Fetches and merges changes from a remote branch. | `git pull origin main` |
| `git push <remote-name> <branch-name>` | Pushes local commits to a remote branch. | `git push origin main` |

---

## 6. Viewing and Undoing Changes

### When to Use
These commands allow you to view commit history, see differences between files, and undo changes as needed.

| Command | Description | Example |
| ------- | ----------- | ------- |

| `git diff` | Shows differences between the working directory and staging area. | `git diff index.html` |
| `git checkout -- <file>` | Discards changes in the working directory. | `git checkout -- index.html` |
| `git revert <commit-hash>` | Creates a new commit that undoes a specific commit. | `git revert a1b2c3d4` |
| `git reset <commit-hash>` | Resets the current branch to a specific commit. Options: `--soft`, `--mixed`, or `--hard`. | `git reset --hard HEAD~1` |

---

## 7. Stashing and Cleaning

### When to Use
These commands help you temporarily save changes or remove untracked files, allowing you to switch branches or clear clutter in the working directory.

| ------- | ----------- | ------- |
| `git stash` | Saves changes in a stash to apply later. | `git stash` |
| `git stash apply` | Applies the latest stashed changes to the working directory. | `git stash apply` |
| `git stash clear` | Clears all stashes from the stash list. | `git stash clear` |
| `git clean -f` | Removes untracked files from the working directory. | `git clean -f` |

## 8. Additional Commands

### When to Use
These additional commands are useful for specific tasks, like renaming branches, viewing specific commits, or cleaning up commit history.

| Command | Description | Example |
| ------- | ----------- | ------- |
| `git show <commit-hash>` | Displays the changes made in a specific commit. | `git show a1b2c3d4` |
| `git branch -v` | Shows branches with their last commit info. | `git branch -v` |
| `git branch -m <new-name>` | Renames the current branch. | `git branch -m new-branch-name` |
